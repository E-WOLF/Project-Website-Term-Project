information sources, as well as gauge a sense of the overall tone and demeanor of the user.

2. Keep queries under a few hundred tweets per the API's requirements. 
3. It might take a few seconds to load given the functionality of the web-based API's that it uses.

2. Implement keyword sentiment anlaysis searches, filtering out only a bot's tweets. 
3. Make the website more user friendly, UI & UX more appealing.
